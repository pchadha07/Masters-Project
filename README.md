# Masters-Project
The main aim of this research is to develop a hierarchical  network architecture capable of answering the Kaggle task  query based on learning of content in extensive dataset. 
The research objectives are formulated based on the aim of 
this study which is as follows:
• To develop robust and efficient question and answer 
model capable of learning content from exhaustive list of 
research documents and answer the task questions.
• To suggest the best performing hierarchical model 
network with respect to answers generated by model 
network options being considered.
• To develop evaluation metric strategy most suited to 
judge the performance of model.
• To identify appropriate granularity level to be considered 
for input sequence .
