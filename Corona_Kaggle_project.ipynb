      "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV has been transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly have some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. The 2019-nCoV is spreading from person to person in China and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in some countries outside China. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. There is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV. According to Lu et al, 2020 [1] , genome sequence of 2019-nCoV is closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) are sequenced from 2019-nCoV infected patients [2]. HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is around 66% identical to those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related coronavirus. But the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological activity of this virus. Coronaviruses encode large replicase polyproteins which are proteolytically processed by viral proteases to generate mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) that form the viral replication complex. Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, can induce cellular membrane rearrangements during replication to form replication organelles which allows efficient viral RNA synthesis. Nonstructural Protein 4 alone induces membrane pairing in infectious bronchitis virus [3]. Infection with coronavirus causes rearrangement in the host cell membrane to accumulate a replication and transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and transcription of viral mRNA can occur. For coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has now been identified with non-structural protein 1 in a murine model of coronavirus infection [4]. Sakai et al in 2017 [5] highlighted the role of nsp4 of SARS coronavirus in viral replication. It has been discovered that only a change in two amino acids in nsp4 protein sequence can abolish viral replication completely. So, to prevent coronavirus infection by designing vaccine, nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus can be selected as target protein in this study. Prevention of viral diseases by vaccination purposes for controlled induction of protective immune responses against viral pathogens such as small pox, hepatitis etc. Attenuated viral vaccines can be produced by targeting essential pathogenicity factors. This study has implicated for the rational design of live attenuated coronavirus vaccines aiming to prevent coronavirus-induced diseases of human as well as animal origin, including the lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome. In this study nonstructural protein 4 has been analyzed in order to predict informative epitopes which will help for future vaccine designing. The knowledge of peptide vaccine is used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes which can induce specific immune responses [6] , [7]. These designed epitopes will offer cost effective, high quality therapeutics against corona virus. By using online algorithms in immunoinformatics, potentially active immunogenic T and B cell epitopes for this viral protein has been identified and modelled to design possible peptide vaccine for coronavirus infection. The protein family information of Coronavirus nonstructural protein NS4 containing 78 protein is retrieved from InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR005603/). To find conserved region, retrieved sequences were aligned using Muscle tool 3.8.31 [8] where k-mer clustering is used. In the next step a phylogenetic tree is constructed by the method known as progressive alignment. The evolutionary divergence analysis for all 78 virus proteins are completed by forming a phylogenetic tree using Phy ML 3.1/3.0 aLRT software [9]. Here the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method. The default substitution model was selected assuming an estimated proportional of invariant sites (of 0.008) and 4 gammadistributed rate categorized to account for rate heterogenicity across sites. The gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data (gamma = 1.788). Reliability for internal branch was assessed using the aLRT test (SH-like). Among these proteins non-structural protein NS4, with accession number A0A0A7UXD8, known as Beta coronavirus HKU24 (due to its Chinese origin) with length 136 is selected in FASTA format. Antigenicity of this protein is predicted by VaxiJen v 2.0, an online prediction server [10]. B cell epitopes are part of allergen which come in interaction with B lymphocytes to induce immune response. Among two types of B cell epitopes, linear type of B cell epitopes is predicted. Various physico-chemical properties e.g. hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity of peptides chains have been estimated to identify the locations of linear epitopes of an antigenic protein [11]. Thus, different tools from IEDB (www.iedb.org), including the classical propensity scale methods such as Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale [12] , E mini surface accessibility prediction [13] , Parker hydrophilicity prediction [14] , Karplus and Schulz flexibilty prediction [15] , Bepipred linear epitope prediction [16] and Chou and Fashman beta turn prediction tool [17] are used to predict linear or continous B cell epitopes of nonstructural protein NS4 protein in coronavirus. With the help of graphical findings and prediction scores the most probable B cell epitope of that antigenic protein has been identified. BepiPred prediction method is a combination of Hidden Markov model and propensity scale method to predict score and identification of B cell epitopes of antigenic protein [16]. Linear T-cell epitopes for MHC-I binding for nonstructural protein NS4 protein in coronavirus are recognized by consensus methods using various methods such as Artificial neural network (ANN) [18] , Stabilized matrix method (SMM) [19] and Scoring Matrices Derived from Combinatorial Peptide Libraries (Comblib) from tools for MHC -I binding prediction methods of Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (www.iedb.org) [20]. This serverbased method forecasts the MHC class I binding predication to 26 MHC supertypes as percentile rank. SMM algorithm of MHC-1 binding, transporter of antigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency are also considered to determine the IC 50 values for processing prediction of epitopes by MHC-I molecules [21]. On the basis of low IC 50 values, 5 best epitopes bind with specific MHC-1 molecules are elected for further evaluation. CD4+ T-cell receptor responses against concerned nonstructural protein NS4 protein are done by using Peptide binding to MHC class II molecules software using MHC II binding prediction tool in IEDB analysis resource, including a consensus approach which combines NNalign, SMM-align [21] and Combinatorial library methods. For this prediction we chose thirty HLA class II alleles from the reference set. For the predicted T-cell epitopes with low percentile rank are identified and their IC50 values for respective alleles are determined by SMM-align method [22]. Population coverage for identified T cell epitopes is assessed for world, as well as China and Indian population with the help of IEDB population coverage calculation tool [23]. This tool calculates the fraction of individuals predicted to reply to a specified set of epitopes with recognized MHC restrictions. This calculation is finished considering the HLA genotypic frequencies assuming non-linkage disequilibrium between HLA loci. For docking studies, the T cell epitope PTDTYTSVY (MHC I restricted) and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG (MHC II restricted) are selected and subjected to PEP-FOLD server [24] , [25] for 3D structure formation. To identify the molecular interactions with specific HLA protein for respective epitopes, docking studies are performed with ClusPro 2.2 web server [26]. Cluster scores for lowest binding energy prediction are calculated using the formula-E = 0.40E_{rep} + -0.40E_{att} + 600E_{elec} + 1.00E_{DARS}. Here, repulsive, attractive, electrostatic as well as interactions extracted from the decoys as the reference state, are considered for structure-based pairwise potential calculation in epitope-MHC molecule docking [27]. Modified PDB ID 4NQX for HLA-A*01:01 is used as allelic protein for docking study of T cell epitope with MHC I restricted. Similarly, 3D structure (PDB ID 1FV1) for HLA-DRB5*01:01 MHC molecule is used as receptor molecule for T cell epitope docking analysis with MHC II restriction. From InterPro database, 78 homologous protein sequences are recovered for nonstructural protein NS4 protein for coronavirus as shown in Table 1. A phylogenetic tree illustrating the evolutionary relationship among the 78 homologous non-structural protein 4 of coronavirus is depicted in Figure 1a and the relevant enlarged version is shown in Figure 1b. author/funder.

Conserved regions are highlighted. Potential T-cell epitope prediction Among the five peptide sequences, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 peptide sequence (MHC I restricted) and 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 (MHC II restricted) are selected as most probable T cell epitope for the antigenic protein present in non-structural protein NS4 of beta coronavirus HKU24 on the basis of its interactions with highest number of alleles (Table 2 and 3 ).

IEDB population coverage tool [23] is used to calculate the population coverage of the predicted epitopes. The result for class I MHC restriction for the China, whole world and Indian population with the selected MHC I alleles is shown in Table 4. Predicted T-cell epitopes Interacting MHC-I alleles RTPPTSVVTSGDDGRV 71 reveals that these short stretches of antigenic protein can act as linear B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 (MHC II restricted) is selected on the basis of its interactions with large number of alleles and lowest IC50 value with HLA-DRB5*01:01 MHC II allele. Similarly, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 , restricted with MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 is designated as most probable T cell epitope which is also present in conserved region of non-structural protein NS4 of coronavirus. Docking studies are performed with these two epitopes with human HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II molecule and MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 respectively. Docking study of PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG epitope with HLA-DRB5*01:01, shows lowest binding energy -786.0 Kcal/mole, shown in Figure 4. Docking structure is stabilized by H bonds, are shown in Table 6. Interaction between T cell epitope PTDTYTSVY MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 with binding energy -725.0 Kcal/mole is shown in Figure 5.  At present in China and whole world, considering the emergency situation due to corona virus infection, rapid development in vaccine design is the most argent step to prevent pandemics. Because by using vaccine the mortality rate due to coronavirus can be controlled. This technique is applied successfully for smallpox virus, polio virus etc. Though for some other common viruses such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus, vaccine has not been invented till now. Due to lack of definite information about growth, replication and pathogenesis of these viruses. Therefore, computational techniques are used for epitope mapping, which is the preliminary step for vaccine design to prevent coronavirus infection. This study integrates several immunoinformatics and molecular docking methods to recognize potential epitopes of non-structural protein NS4 in coronavirus. At first, all seventy-nine non-structural protein 4 from different coronaviruses are retrieved from InterPro database and aligned to detect conserved sequences present in them. A phylogenetic investigation reveals a closed evolutionary relationship among these homologous author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422 doi: bioRxiv preprint proteins. Non-structural protein 4 is considered as our protein of interest for vaccine design assuming its role in viral replication during coronavirus infection and considering its antigenic nature in human. Not only that, this selected protein has structural similarity with non-structural protein 4 present in rat, murine coronavirus containing various strains. Therefore, the proposed peptide-based vaccine might be effective to prevent coronavirus infection not only in human, but also in rat, murine etc. Here, computational method for vaccine design is totally safe, rapid and cost effective at this emergency situation, caused due to coronavirus infection. Five potent T cell epitope having potentiality for binding with MHC molecules are predicted. For MHC I and MHC II molecules both 9 mer and 15 mer peptide structures are projected from IEDB recommended prediction method and modeled by peptide modeling algorithm. The percentile rank and IC 50 values with SMM/ANN method covering all MHC class I supertypes are also analyzed. The five most effective epitopes are presented in Table 2 along with their IC 50 values. For MHC I binding prediction scores, the peptide with the lowest percentile rank and IC 50 value, is selected for their highest affinity for that interacting MHC I allele. The T cell epitope 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 is considered on the basis of its interaction with large number of alleles and lowest IC 50 value with HLA-A*01:01 MHC I allele. For this epitope, MHC I processing score with that specific allele comprises proteasome score 1.25, TAP score 1.02, MHC IC 50 value is 6.7 nm. This means that this specific epitope has high affinity to MHC I molecule during antigen presentation. Moreover that, this epitope when interacting with selective MHC I allele shows the highest population coverage not only for Chinese population, but also has higher population coverage compared to other epitopes, for Indian and whole world population. Henceforth, this epitope is considered as epitope of choice for CD8 + T cells. Likewise, presence of wider peptide binding groove in MHC II molecule than that of MHC I, 15 mer epitopes are investigated by smm/nn/sturnilo method along with their IC 50 values and are listed in Table 3. For MHC II binding prediction method, a 15 mer T cell epitope sequence 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 of non-structural protein 4, displays a percentile rank 22.0 with IC 50 value 22.0 at the time of interaction with HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II allele. This result approves that this peptide can be selected as T cell epitope with MHC II restriction for our protein of interest. Moreover, this T cell epitope sequence is well conserved among the nonstructural protein 4 present in different corona viruses. B cell epitope identification method, the prediction scores for Emini surface accessibility, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fashman beta turn and Karplus and Schulz flexibility for each residue of peptides IRNTTNPSAR, starting from sequence 38 position and ending at 47 position of that viral antigenic protein, predicts that this is the most potent B cell epitope present in it. Additionally, Kolarskar and Tangaonkar antigenicity prediction values, confirm our estimation. The predicted T cell epitopes are validated by using molecular docking study. These two epitopes are preferably fitted in the epitope binding grooves of the two MHC protein molecules with highly negative binding energies and stabilized by H-bonds. author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422 doi: bioRxiv preprint An important factor in vaccine design is the distribution of selected HLA allelic protein. This distribution varies among the human population according to the population in different geographic regions of the world. Our predicted T cell epitope, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 , bound with MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele, which is present among 58.87% and 45.77% of Chinese and Indian populations respectively and 50.16% of world populations. So, it may be concluded that the predicted T cell epitope must be specifically restricted with the predominant MHC molecule, which is present in target population in India and China, as well as in whole world against coronavirus. Though in general most peptide-based vaccines are developed considering B cell epitopes, in our present study both B cell and T cell epitopes, present in non-structural protein 4, are considered for vaccine design against coronavirus. These two T cell epitopes can stimulate immunogenic response after administration inside the human body. This immunological reaction can prevent coronavirus infection in human as well as rat and murine, when they come in contact with this virus in future. Since these epitopes are well restricted with MHC molecules and at the same time, they are almost conserved among other homologous proteins. These proteins include non-structural protein 4, obtained from novel-coronavirus infected patient in China. Thus, these epitopes can be proceeded for further experimental verification during vaccine designing against coronavirus infection. This work is not supported by any funding.\n"

      "The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.\n"

      "['ABSTRACTThe cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores −725.0 Kcal/mole and −786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.']\n"

       "      <td>background personal protective equipment (ppe) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (hcp) from infectious diseases. when transmission-based ppe ensembles are not appropriate, hcp must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select ppe. because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of ppe ensembles to protect hcp against infectious diseases. methods the approach used in this study included the following 4 steps : (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of ppe, and (4) evaluation of selected ppe. selected ppe should protect hcp from exposure, be usable by hcp, and fit for purpose. results the approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. as expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of ppe for these 2 pathogens. discussion a systematic risk-based approach to the selection of ppe will help health care facilities and hcp select ppe when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. owing to the complexity of ppe ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. conclusions participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by hcp.</td>\n",

       "0    the transmission modes of sars-coronavirus appear to be through droplet spread, close contact and fomites although air borne transmission has not been ruled out. this clearly places dental personnel at risks as they work in close proximity to their patients employing droplet and aerosol generating procedures. although the principle of universal precautions is widely advocated and followed throughout the dental community, additional precautionary measures — termed standard precaution may be necessary to help control the spread of this highly contagious disease. patient assessment should include questions on recent travel to sars infected areas and, contacts of patients, fever and symptoms of respiratory infections. special management protocols and modified measures that regulate droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental setting have to be introduced and may include the reduction or avoidance of droplet / aerosol generation, the disinfection of the treatment field, application of rubber dam, pre-procedural antiseptic mouthrinse and the dilution and efficient removal of contaminated ambient air. the gag, cough or vomiting reflexes that lead to the generation of aerosols should also be prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1    abstract the presence of patients with diverse pathologies in hospitals results in an environment that can be rich in various microorganisms including respiratory and enteric viruses, leading to outbreaks in hospitals or spillover infections to the community. all hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised /-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. these pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. the relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating ; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings.   \n",
       "2    abstract viral infections can be transmitted by various routes. at one extreme, airborne or droplet viral infections (e. g., varicella zoster, ebola) are highly contagious. most viruses can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. mass gatherings, clinical, and chronic care facilities may be hotspots for virus spread when transmission is via aerosols, droplets, or fomites (contaminated surfaces). environmental factors which are often important for virus survival may include the ambient humidity, temperature, and ph of the environment they are in, so many viruses survive only a few hours in the environment and are often readily inactivated by common hygiene techniques, such as using soap and water, and some detergents, disinfectants, and antiseptics. sexually transmitted viral infections, such as herpes simplex, are often transmitted by close mucosal contacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3    infection of healthcare workers with the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated coronavirus (sars-cov) is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission. however, infrequent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and droplet precautions, particularly during certain aerosol-generating medical procedures. we investigated a possible cluster of sars-cov infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a sars patient. unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. however, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of sars-cov. on the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of sars transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following : 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles &lt;5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.

       "      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.</td>\n",

Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protectingstaff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection.

Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing an important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks. The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19.

Similar to SARS-CoV (which was responsible for the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic), SARS-CoV-2 bears an envelope spike protein that is primed by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to facilitate fusion of the virus with the cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and subsequent cell entry.

Once scientists know the sequences of the fragments, they can computationally stitch the whole genome back together with the help of a reference sequence from a closely related virus.\\nSome of this work is conducted at large, specialized facilities, but because of advances in technology, genome sequencing can also be carried out in smaller labs.

While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. The number of mutations is relatively low, with mode per sample equaling 6, an average of 7.23, and very few samples having more than 15 events. Overall, no continent differs significantly from the average mutation rate, but there is a significant difference (one-way ANOVA p = 9.55 × 10?205) in the average number of mutations per sample between countries. Specifically, amongst the top 40 nations with the highest number of sequenced full viral genomes, these countries have a slightly but significant higher number of observed mutations per sample, when compared to the world's average: India: (8.40), Congo (8.30), Bangladesh (9.83), and Kazakhstan (9.47). On the other hand, the sequences from the following countries show a significantly lower mutational burden: Germany (6.09), Japan (4.55), Italy (5.92), Greece (5.91), Hong Kong (5.00), and Kenya (5.38). One must bear in mind that some sampling biases may affect this comparison: for example, some countries have generated the highest number of sequences in the early phases of the pandemic, and may have therefore observed fewer mutations (for example, Italy has not shared any sequence in the months of May and June 2020, the last two considered in our analysis). On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (&gt;50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country. Upon manual inspection, these sequences do not appear to share similarities between each other, and are likely the product of technical sequencing errors.</td>\n",

       "0   Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 ?m in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5?m in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal?oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.   \n",
       "1   An incubation period is the time between when you contract a virus and when your symptoms start.\\nCurrently, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure.\\nAccording to a recent reportTrusted Source, more than 97 percent of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure. The average incubation period seems to be around 5 days. However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.\\nFor many people, COVID-19 symptoms start as mild symptoms and gradually get worse over a few days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2   The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3   The new coronavirus can be transmitted by people who are infected but before their symptoms appear – pre-symptomatic carriers.

In some extremely cool and humid weathers, the required physical distance may reach as far as 6 m.\\nAlternatively,  a  relaxed  standard  of  1.4 m is able to block 95% of viruses carried by respiratory droplets  (excluding  that  carried  by  aerosol  particles)  and  shows  negligible weather dependence. \\nThere  is  a  slight  increase  of  PM2.5  floating  in  air  in  hot  and  dry  weather,  owing  to  the increased suspension time. \\nImproper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "6   Personal protective equipmenthas become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus (COVID-19)epidemic. COVID-19 is predominantly causedby contact or droplet transmissionattributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately onemetrefrom the patient. Airborne transmission may occur ifpatient respiratory activity or medical proceduresgenerate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distancesand remain airborne longer,but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevantduring airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protectingstaff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care –contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipmentuse is not.Only airborne precautionsinclude a fitted high-filtrationmask,and this should bereserved for aerosol-generating procedures.Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipmentincluding use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.  \\nAs per WHO, in countries and/or subnational regions in which community transmission has become established, or that are at risk of entering this phase of an epidemic, authorities must immediately adopt and adapt population-level distancing measures and movement restrictions in addition to other public health and health system measures to reduce exposure and suppress transmission, including the following:\\nPersonal measures that reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission, such as hand washing, physicaldistancing, and respiratory etiquette;\\nCommunity-level measures to reduce contact between individuals, such as the suspension of mass gatherings,theclosure of non-essential places of work and educational establishments, and reduced public transport;\\nMeasures to reduce the risk of importation or reintroduction of the virus from high-transmission areas, such as limits on national and international travel, enhanced screeningand quarantine;\\nMeasures to ensure the protection of health workers andvulnerable groups, such as through the provision of correctpersonal protective equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8   One of the studies, revealed a number of unreported mutations, which cover both mismatches and deletions in translated and untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Moreover, the geo-climate distribution of the mutations deciphered higher unique mutations as well as disease severity in the European temperate countries. Further investigations should focus on structural validations and subsequent phenotypic consequences of the deletions and/or mismatches in transmission dynamics of the current epidemics and the immediate implications of these genomic markers to develop potential prophylaxis and mitigation for tackling the crisis of pandemic COVID-19. Moreover, the identification of the conformational changes in mutated protein structures and untranslated cis-acting elements is of significance for studying the virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This mutational diversity should be investigated by further studies, including their metabolic functional pathway, intra-viral and virus-host interactions analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "9   The availability of established diagnostic technologies have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing an important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks. The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19. This process can curb the spread of infectious pathogens and reduce mortality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "11  One of the comparative analysis of COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension showed that hypertensive patients had greater disease severity and adverse progression than nonhypertensive patients. However, this result may be related to the higher age in this group than in nonhypertension group. In addition, there were more severe symptoms; greater likelihood of other complications, such as diabetes; more likelihood of transfer to the ICU; and worse laboratory indicators. COVID-19 patients with hypertension need additional attention to prevent adverse outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "13  COPD patients have increased risk of severe pneumonia and poor outcomes when they develop COVID-19. This may be related to poor underlying lung reserves or increased expression of ACE-2 receptor in small airways.\\nThe  recent evidence that COPD patients and smokers may display the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry differently has come to light. Similar to SARS-CoV (which was responsible for the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic), SARS-CoV-2 bears an envelope spike protein that is primed by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to facilitate fusion of the virus with the cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and subsequent cell entry. Current smoking was also associated with higher ACE-2 expression compared with former and never smokers, an observation which has subsequently been validated by other groups in separate cohorts of lung tissue and airway epithelial samples and supported by additional evidence linking ACE-2 expression with nicotine exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "14  COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "15  Researchers are still learning how COVID-19 affects pregnant women. Current reports suggest that pregnant women may have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that:\\nPregnant women with COVID-19 may be more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU) or need a ventilator (for breathing support).\\nPregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions.\\nPregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness from COVID-19 than other pregnant women. But it’s not about biology. Black and Hispanic women face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "16  Initially, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that the percentage of infected individuals who die from COVID-19 was 3.4%. That statistic is called the infection fatality rate (IFR) – or colloquially, the death rate – and means that for every hundred people infected with COVID-19, on average, between three and four would die.\\nAs time has gone on, it has become clear that the true risk of death is much lower. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently has a best guess of 0.65% for the IFR. But current estimates fall anywhere between 0.2% and 1%, a surprisingly large range when calculating the infection fatality rate should be as simple as dividing the number of deaths by total infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

There is no evidence that viruses can spread to people or other animals from a pet's skin, fur or hair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "19  Current data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly or indirectly from a bat coronavirus, but these findings remain suggestive rather than conclusive because genetic and other investigations are still at a preliminary stage. There is substantial diversity among SARS-like coronaviruses circulating in bats and other animals and the identification of precisely where the virus originated will need further sampling and surveillance of animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "20  \\n\\nSeveral methods exist for scientists to sequence an RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2. One common technique begins with collecting viral RNA and breaking it into small fragments. Scientists then transcribe the sequences into DNA and amplify them with polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescent markers in the reaction mixture help reveal the identity of the sequences being generated. Once scientists know the sequences of the fragments, they can computationally stitch the whole genome back together with the help of a reference sequence from a closely related virus.\\nSome of this work is conducted at large, specialized facilities, but because of advances in technology, genome sequencing can also be carried out in smaller labs. Hospitals and universities around the world are collecting samples from people with COVID-19. Some in-house sequencing devices are the size of a smartphone or suitcase, and many can report a genome sequence within 7–8 h.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "21  As per one of the analysis of of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2, a total of 353,341 mutation events were highlighted compared to the NC_045512.2 Wuhan reference genome. While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. The number of mutations is relatively low, with mode per sample equaling 6, an average of 7.23, and very few samples having more than 15 events. Overall, no continent differs significantly from the average mutation rate, but there is a significant difference (one-way ANOVA p = 9.55 × 10?205) in the average number of mutations per sample between countries. Specifically, amongst the top 40 nations with the highest number of sequenced full viral genomes, these countries have a slightly but significant higher number of observed mutations per sample, when compared to the world's average: India: (8.40), Congo (8.30), Bangladesh (9.83), and Kazakhstan (9.47). On the other hand, the sequences from the following countries show a significantly lower mutational burden: Germany (6.09), Japan (4.55), Italy (5.92), Greece (5.91), Hong Kong (5.00), and Kenya (5.38). One must bear in mind that some sampling biases may affect this comparison: for example, some countries have generated the highest number of sequences in the early phases of the pandemic, and may have therefore observed fewer mutations (for example, Italy has not shared any sequence in the months of May and June 2020, the last two considered in our analysis). On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (>50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country. Upon manual inspection, these sequences do not appear to share similarities between each other, and are likely the product of technical sequencing errors.                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "      <td>Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are &gt;5-10 ?m in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are &lt;5?m in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles &lt;5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal?oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.</td>\n",

In some extremely cool and humid weathers, the required physical distance may reach as far as 6 m.\\nAlternatively,  a  relaxed  standard  of  1.4 m is able to block 95% of viruses carried by respiratory droplets  (excluding  that  carried  by  aerosol  particles)  and  shows  negligible weather dependence. \\nThere  is  a  slight  increase  of  PM2.5  floating  in  air  in  hot  and  dry  weather,  owing  to  the increased suspension time. \\nImproper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.</td>\n",

       "0  Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 ?m in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5?m in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal?oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.   \n",
       "1  An incubation period is the time between when you contract a virus and when your symptoms start.\\nCurrently, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure.\\nAccording to a recent reportTrusted Source, more than 97 percent of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure. The average incubation period seems to be around 5 days. However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.\\nFor many people, COVID-19 symptoms start as mild symptoms and gradually get worse over a few days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3  The new coronavirus can be transmitted by people who are infected but before their symptoms appear – pre-symptomatic carriers. There is evidence that infected people who never develop symptoms – asymptomatic carriers – can also transmit coronavirus.

       "4  The main findings as per one of the studies related to effects of environemnt on COVID 19 are: Hot  and  dry  weather  can  reduce  infections  caused  by  droplet  contact,  but  the  risk  of transmission via aerosol particles is increased. \\nCool and humid weather can effectively suppress the formation of aerosol particles, but it also facilitates the spreading of large droplets. \\nThe current social distancing standard is insufficient in eliminating all droplet contacts. In some extremely cool and humid weathers, the required physical distance may reach as far as 6 m.\\nAlternatively,  a  relaxed  standard  of  1.4 m is able to block 95% of viruses carried by respiratory droplets  (excluding  that  carried  by  aerosol  particles)  and  shows  negligible weather dependence. \\nThere  is  a  slight  increase  of  PM2.5  floating  in  air  in  hot  and  dry  weather,  owing  to  the increased suspension time. \\nImproper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "      <td>summary microorganisms, particularly bacteria, are frequently found in the lower airways of copd patients, both in stable state and during exacerbations. the host – pathogen relationship in copd is a complex, dynamic process characterised by frequent changes in pathogens, their strains and loads, and subsequent host immune responses. exacerbations are detrimental events in the course of copd and evidence suggests that 70 % may be caused by microorganisms. when considering bacterial exacerbations, recent findings based on molecular typing have demonstrated that the acquisition of new strains of bacteria or antigenic changes in pre-existing strains are the most important triggers for exacerbation onset. even in clinically stable copd patients the presence of microorganisms in their lower airways may cause harmful effects and induce chronic low-grade airway inflammation leading to increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function and impaired health-related quality of life. besides intraluminal localisation in the distal airways, bacteria can be found in the bronchial walls and parenchymal lung tissue of copd patients. therefore, the isolation of pathogenic bacteria in stable copd should be considered as a form of chronic infection rather than colonisation. this new approach may have important implications for the management of patients with copd.</td>\n",

       "      <td>covid-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in wuhan, hubei province, china, in december 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide (1,2). as of 18 march 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of covid-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in china (3242) and italy (2505) (3). however, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors (4). smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases (5). smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases (6). previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous mers-cov outbreak (7,8). given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on covid-19 that included information on patients ’ smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and covid-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (icu) hospitalization and death. the literature search was conducted on 17 march 2020, using two databases (pubmed, sciencedirect), with the search terms : [ ‘ smoking ’ or ‘ tobacco ’ or ‘ risk factors ’ or ‘ smoker * ’ ] and [ ‘ covid-19 ’ or ‘ covid 19 ’ or ‘ novel coronavirus ’ or ‘ sars cov-2 ’ or ‘ sars cov 2 ’ ] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in english and referred to humans. we also searched the reference lists of the studies included. a total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. all of the studies were conducted in china, four in wuhan and one across provinces in mainland china. the populations in all studies were patients with covid-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. with regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the covid-19 pandemic (december 2019, january 2020). specifically, zhou et al. (9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with covid-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. among those that died, 9 % were current smokers compared to 4 % among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p = 0. 21) with regard to mortality from covid-19. similarly, zhang et al. (10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with covid-19. the results showed that among severe patients (n = 58), 3. 4 % were current smokers and 6. 9 % were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n = 82) among which 0 % were current smokers and 3. 7 % were former smokers, leading to an or of 2. 23 ; (95 % ci : 0. 65 – 7. 63 ; p = 0. 2). huang et al. (11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 among 41 patients. in this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an icu (n = 13) was a current smoker. in contrast, three patients from the non-icu group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p = 0. 31), albeit the small sample size of the study. the largest study population of 1099 patients with covid-19 was provided by guan et al. (12) from multiple regions of mainland china. descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. among the patients with severe symptoms, 16. 9 % were current smokers and 5. 2 % were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11. 8 % were current smokers and 1. 3 % were former smokers. additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an icu or died, 25. 5 % were current smokers and 7. 6 % were former smokers. in contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11. 8 % were current smokers and 1. 6 % were former smokers. no statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. finally, liu et al. (13) found among their population of 78 patients with covid-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27. 3 %) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3. 0 %), with this difference statistically significant at the p = 0. 018 level. in their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (or = 14. 28 ; 95 % ci : 1. 58 – 25. 00 ; p = 0. 018). we identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with covid-19. notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed icu support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases (12). however, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1. 4 times more likely (rr = 1. 4,95 % ci : 0. 98 – 2. 00) to have severe symptoms of covid-19 and approximately 2. 4 times more likely to be admitted to an icu, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (rr = 2. 4,95 % ci : 1. 43 – 4. 04). in conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of covid-19.</td>\n",

       "0   the transmission modes of sars-coronavirus appear to be through droplet spread, close contact and fomites although air borne transmission has not been ruled out. this clearly places dental personnel at risks as they work in close proximity to their patients employing droplet and aerosol generating procedures. although the principle of universal precautions is widely advocated and followed throughout the dental community, additional precautionary measures — termed standard precaution may be necessary to help control the spread of this highly contagious disease. patient assessment should include questions on recent travel to sars infected areas and, contacts of patients, fever and symptoms of respiratory infections. special management protocols and modified measures that regulate droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental setting have to be introduced and may include the reduction or avoidance of droplet / aerosol generation, the disinfection of the treatment field, application of rubber dam, pre-procedural antiseptic mouthrinse and the dilution and efficient removal of contaminated ambient air. the gag, cough or vomiting reflexes that lead to the generation of aerosols should also be prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1   abstract the presence of patients with diverse pathologies in hospitals results in an environment that can be rich in various microorganisms including respiratory and enteric viruses, leading to outbreaks in hospitals or spillover infections to the community. all hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised /-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. these pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. the relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating ; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings.   \n",
       "2   abstract viral infections can be transmitted by various routes. at one extreme, airborne or droplet viral infections (e. g., varicella zoster, ebola) are highly contagious. most viruses can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. mass gatherings, clinical, and chronic care facilities may be hotspots for virus spread when transmission is via aerosols, droplets, or fomites (contaminated surfaces). environmental factors which are often important for virus survival may include the ambient humidity, temperature, and ph of the environment they are in, so many viruses survive only a few hours in the environment and are often readily inactivated by common hygiene techniques, such as using soap and water, and some detergents, disinfectants, and antiseptics. sexually transmitted viral infections, such as herpes simplex, are often transmitted by close mucosal contacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3   infection of healthcare workers with the severe acute respiratory syndrome – associated coronavirus (sars-cov) is thought to occur primarily by either contact or large respiratory droplet transmission. however, infrequent healthcare worker infections occurred despite the use of contact and droplet precautions, particularly during certain aerosol-generating medical procedures. we investigated a possible cluster of sars-cov infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a sars patient. unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. however, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of sars-cov. on the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of sars transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following : 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4   understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and / or large droplets routes. the cell viability changes of four bacteria species (escherichia coli k12 jm109 ; acinetobacter sp. 5a5 ; pseudomonas oleovorans x5 ; and staphylococcus aureus x8), three gram-negative and one gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 μm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the live / dead baclight solution and a microscope. droplets of three levels of salinity (0,0. 9, and 36 % w / v) were tested. all four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40 – 45 min. the final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. droplet evaporation over the first 35 – 40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. the lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "65  our research is motivated by the rapidly-evolving outbreaks of rare and fatal infectious diseases, for example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and the middle east respiratory syndrome. in many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. while a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (hais), which must be considered at an individual level. our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective hai outbreak control and prompt responses. our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components – time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and hai parameter estimation – and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. we conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 sars in hong kong. the evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles &lt;5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.</td>\n",

Similar to SARS-CoV (which was responsible for the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic), SARS-CoV-2 bears an envelope spike protein that is primed by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to facilitate fusion of the virus with the cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and subsequent cell entry. Current smoking was also associated with higher ACE-2 expression compared with former and never smokers, an observation which has subsequently been validated by other groups in separate cohorts of lung tissue and airway epithelial samples and supported by additional evidence linking ACE-2 expression with nicotine exposure.</td>\n",

The number of mutations is relatively low, with mode per sample equaling 6, an average of 7.23, and very few samples having more than 15 events. Overall, no continent differs significantly from the average mutation rate, but there is a significant difference (one-way ANOVA p = 9.55 × 10?205) in the average number of mutations per sample between countries. Specifically, amongst the top 40 nations with the highest number of sequenced full viral genomes, these countries have a slightly but significant higher number of observed mutations per sample, when compared to the world's average: India: (8.40), Congo (8.30), Bangladesh (9.83), and Kazakhstan (9.47). On the other hand, the sequences from the following countries show a significantly lower mutational burden: Germany (6.09), Japan (4.55), Italy (5.92), Greece (5.91), Hong Kong (5.00), and Kenya (5.38). One must bear in mind that some sampling biases may affect this comparison: for example, some countries have generated the highest number of sequences in the early phases of the pandemic, and may have therefore observed fewer mutations (for example, Italy has not shared any sequence in the months of May and June 2020, the last two considered in our analysis). On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (&gt;50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country.

       "0   Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 ?m in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5?m in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal?oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.   \n",
       "1   An incubation period is the time between when you contract a virus and when your symptoms start.\\nCurrently, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure.\\nAccording to a recent reportTrusted Source, more than 97 percent of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure. The average incubation period seems to be around 5 days.

       "2   The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

While pre-symptomatic carriers appear to be an important source of infection, the role of asymptomatic carriers is less clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4   The main findings as per one of the studies related to effects of environemnt on COVID 19 are: Hot  and  dry  weather  can  reduce  infections  caused  by  droplet  contact,  but  the  risk  of transmission via aerosol particles is increased. \\nCool and humid weather can effectively suppress the formation of aerosol particles, but it also facilitates the spreading of large droplets. \\nThe current social distancing standard is insufficient in eliminating all droplet contacts. In some extremely cool and humid weathers, the required physical distance may reach as far as 6 m.\\nAlternatively,  a  relaxed  standard  of  1.4 m is able to block 95% of viruses carried by respiratory droplets  (excluding  that  carried  by  aerosol  particles)  and  shows  negligible weather dependence. \\nThere  is  a  slight  increase  of  PM2.5  floating  in  air  in  hot  and  dry  weather,  owing  to  the increased suspension time. \\nImproper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "6   Personal protective equipmenthas become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus (COVID-19)epidemic. COVID-19 is predominantly causedby contact or droplet transmissionattributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately onemetrefrom the patient. Airborne transmission may occur ifpatient respiratory activity or medical proceduresgenerate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distancesand remain airborne longer,but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevantduring airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protectingstaff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care –contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipmentuse is not.Only airborne precautionsinclude a fitted high-filtrationmask,and this should bereserved for aerosol-generating procedures.Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipmentincluding use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.  \\nAs per WHO, in countries and/or subnational regions in which community transmission has become established, or that are at risk of entering this phase of an epidemic, authorities must immediately adopt and adapt population-level distancing measures and movement restrictions in addition to other public health and health system measures to reduce exposure and suppress transmission, including the following:\\nPersonal measures that reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission, such as hand washing, physicaldistancing, and respiratory etiquette;\\nCommunity-level measures to reduce contact between individuals, such as the suspension of mass gatherings,theclosure of non-essential places of work and educational establishments, and reduced public transport;\\nMeasures to reduce the risk of importation or reintroduction of the virus from high-transmission areas, such as limits on national and international travel, enhanced screeningand quarantine;\\nMeasures to ensure the protection of health workers andvulnerable groups, such as through the provision of correctpersonal protective equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8   One of the studies, revealed a number of unreported mutations, which cover both mismatches and deletions in translated and untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Moreover, the geo-climate distribution of the mutations deciphered higher unique mutations as well as disease severity in the European temperate countries. Further investigations should focus on structural validations and subsequent phenotypic consequences of the deletions and/or mismatches in transmission dynamics of the current epidemics and the immediate implications of these genomic markers to develop potential prophylaxis and mitigation for tackling the crisis of pandemic COVID-19. Moreover, the identification of the conformational changes in mutated protein structures and untranslated cis-acting elements is of significance for studying the virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This mutational diversity should be investigated by further studies, including their metabolic functional pathway, intra-viral and virus-host interactions analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "9   The availability of established diagnostic technologies have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing an important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks. The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19. This process can curb the spread of infectious pathogens and reduce mortality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "11  One of the comparative analysis of COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension showed that hypertensive patients had greater disease severity and adverse progression than nonhypertensive patients. However, this result may be related to the higher age in this group than in nonhypertension group. In addition, there were more severe symptoms; greater likelihood of other complications, such as diabetes; more likelihood of transfer to the ICU; and worse laboratory indicators. COVID-19 patients with hypertension need additional attention to prevent adverse outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "13  COPD patients have increased risk of severe pneumonia and poor outcomes when they develop COVID-19. This may be related to poor underlying lung reserves or increased expression of ACE-2 receptor in small airways.\\nThe  recent evidence that COPD patients and smokers may display the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry differently has come to light. Similar to SARS-CoV (which was responsible for the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic), SARS-CoV-2 bears an envelope spike protein that is primed by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to facilitate fusion of the virus with the cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and subsequent cell entry. Current smoking was also associated with higher ACE-2 expression compared with former and never smokers, an observation which has subsequently been validated by other groups in separate cohorts of lung tissue and airway epithelial samples and supported by additional evidence linking ACE-2 expression with nicotine exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "14  COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "15  Researchers are still learning how COVID-19 affects pregnant women. Current reports suggest that pregnant women may have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that:\\nPregnant women with COVID-19 may be more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU) or need a ventilator (for breathing support).\\nPregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions.\\nPregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness from COVID-19 than other pregnant women. But it’s not about biology. Black and Hispanic women face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "16  Initially, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that the percentage of infected individuals who die from COVID-19 was 3.4%. That statistic is called the infection fatality rate (IFR) – or colloquially, the death rate – and means that for every hundred people infected with COVID-19, on average, between three and four would die.\\nAs time has gone on, it has become clear that the true risk of death is much lower. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently has a best guess of 0.65% for the IFR. But current estimates fall anywhere between 0.2% and 1%, a surprisingly large range when calculating the infection fatality rate should be as simple as dividing the number of deaths by total infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

There is no evidence that viruses can spread to people or other animals from a pet's skin, fur or hair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "19  Current data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly or indirectly from a bat coronavirus, but these findings remain suggestive rather than conclusive because genetic and other investigations are still at a preliminary stage. There is substantial diversity among SARS-like coronaviruses circulating in bats and other animals and the identification of precisely where the virus originated will need further sampling and surveillance of animals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "20  \\n\\nSeveral methods exist for scientists to sequence an RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2. One common technique begins with collecting viral RNA and breaking it into small fragments. Scientists then transcribe the sequences into DNA and amplify them with polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescent markers in the reaction mixture help reveal the identity of the sequences being generated. Once scientists know the sequences of the fragments, they can computationally stitch the whole genome back together with the help of a reference sequence from a closely related virus.\\nSome of this work is conducted at large, specialized facilities, but because of advances in technology, genome sequencing can also be carried out in smaller labs. Hospitals and universities around the world are collecting samples from people with COVID-19. Some in-house sequencing devices are the size of a smartphone or suitcase, and many can report a genome sequence within 7–8 h.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "21  As per one of the analysis of of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2, a total of 353,341 mutation events were highlighted compared to the NC_045512.2 Wuhan reference genome. While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. The number of mutations is relatively low, with mode per sample equaling 6, an average of 7.23, and very few samples having more than 15 events. Overall, no continent differs significantly from the average mutation rate, but there is a significant difference (one-way ANOVA p = 9.55 × 10?205) in the average number of mutations per sample between countries. Specifically, amongst the top 40 nations with the highest number of sequenced full viral genomes, these countries have a slightly but significant higher number of observed mutations per sample, when compared to the world's average: India: (8.40), Congo (8.30), Bangladesh (9.83), and Kazakhstan (9.47). On the other hand, the sequences from the following countries show a significantly lower mutational burden: Germany (6.09), Japan (4.55), Italy (5.92), Greece (5.91), Hong Kong (5.00), and Kenya (5.38). One must bear in mind that some sampling biases may affect this comparison: for example, some countries have generated the highest number of sequences in the early phases of the pandemic, and may have therefore observed fewer mutations (for example, Italy has not shared any sequence in the months of May and June 2020, the last two considered in our analysis). On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (>50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country. Upon manual inspection, these sequences do not appear to share similarities between each other, and are likely the product of technical sequencing errors.                                                                                                                                                       \n",

In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

While pre-symptomatic carriers appear to be an important source of infection, the role of asymptomatic carriers is less clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19.  \n",

While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (>50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country. Upon manual inspection, these sequences do not appear to share similarities between each other, and are likely the product of technical sequencing errors.                                                                \n",

       "      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.</td>\n",

As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "4  The main findings as per one of the studies related to effects of environemnt on COVID 19 are: Hot  and  dry  weather  can  reduce  infections  caused  by  droplet  contact,  but  the  risk  of transmission via aerosol particles is increased. \\nCool and humid weather can effectively suppress the formation of aerosol particles, but it also facilitates the spreading of large droplets. \\nThe current social distancing standard is insufficient in eliminating all droplet contacts.

However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "2  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                \n",
       "3  The new coronavirus can be transmitted by people who are infected but before their symptoms appear – pre-symptomatic carriers. There is evidence that infected people who never develop symptoms – asymptomatic carriers – can also transmit coronavirus. While pre-symptomatic carriers appear to be an important source of infection, the role of asymptomatic carriers is less clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4  The main findings as per one of the studies related to effects of environemnt on COVID 19 are: Hot  and  dry  weather  can  reduce  infections  caused  by  droplet  contact,  but  the  risk  of transmission via aerosol particles is increased. Improper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.

    "The proposed model architecture seemed to have generated relevant answers for most questions again and with updates, removed paranthesis such as ')' from start of the answer. However, for the same questions such as \"Can the virus be transmitted asymptomatically or during the incubation period?\" the proposed BERT model with updates to functions was still not able to generate meaningful spans from the shortlisted abstracts, while, there was no span generated for the same queries such as \"What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?\". \n",
    "The results from second iteration highlighted that updating the 'overlapFac' factor did not give meaningful improvements as model was still not able to understand the context for the given query and generate proper span for the same queries as in the first iteration. \n",
    "This means that to improve the performance, proposed BERT model will need to be fine tuned with help of larger queries/reference answers data base along with the existing large context documents database. This is however, not in scope of this research due to paucity of time required to collect data and fine tune the model\n",
    "The filtering condition of removing answer spans starting with prepositions or connecting words such as \"on\", \"at\", \"from\", \"will\", etc helped getting better answer spans from the model\n",
    "The changes to the way summarization of joined answers was carried by the model helped in improving the quality of summarized answers. The setting of minimum length for sentence to be considered helped in only valid sentences to be considered, while, the dynamic 'sentence ratio' settings based on the length of the joined answer made sure relevant information was retained.\n",
    "The summarization of \"reference answers\", using similar conditions as considered for the joined answers, helped in resizing them to reasonable lengths when compared to respective summarized answers without loosing relevant information.  \n",

       "      <td>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.</td>\n",

However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.\\nFor many people, COVID-19 symptoms start as mild symptoms and gradually get worse over a few days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "4  The main findings as per one of the studies related to effects of environemnt on COVID 19 are: Hot  and  dry  weather  can  reduce  infections  caused  by  droplet  contact,  but  the  risk  of transmission via aerosol particles is increased. \\nCool and humid weather can effectively suppress the formation of aerosol particles, but it also facilitates the spreading of large droplets. \\nThe current social distancing standard is insufficient in eliminating all droplet contacts. In some extremely cool and humid weathers, the required physical distance may reach as far as 6 m.\\nAlternatively,  a  relaxed  standard  of  1.4 m is able to block 95% of viruses carried by respiratory droplets  (excluding  that  carried  by  aerosol  particles)  and  shows  negligible weather dependence. \\nThere  is  a  slight  increase  of  PM2.5  floating  in  air  in  hot  and  dry  weather,  owing  to  the increased suspension time. \\nImproper design of ventilation systems can dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles,and consequently increases the likelihood of infections in both modes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.   \n",

Currently, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.

Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity.

Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks. The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance.

       "0   Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 ?m in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are <5?m in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\\nDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). \\nAirborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles <5?m in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m. \\nIn the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \\nThere is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have been no reports of faecal?oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date.   \n",
       "1   An incubation period is the time between when you contract a virus and when your symptoms start.\\nCurrently, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is somewhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure.\\nAccording to a recent reportTrusted Source, more than 97 percent of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure. The average incubation period seems to be around 5 days. However, this estimate may change as we learn more about the virus.\\nFor many people, COVID-19 symptoms start as mild symptoms and gradually get worse over a few days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2   The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. As per  estimate based on analysis from  'Nature Medicine' , the susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, it was found that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "6   Personal protective equipmenthas become an important and emotive subject during the current coronavirus (COVID-19)epidemic. COVID-19 is predominantly causedby contact or droplet transmissionattributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately onemetrefrom the patient. Airborne transmission may occur ifpatient respiratory activity or medical proceduresgenerate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distancesand remain airborne longer,but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevantduring airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protectingstaff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care –contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipmentuse is not.Only airborne precautionsinclude a fitted high-filtrationmask,and this should bereserved for aerosol-generating procedures.Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipmentincluding use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "7   In COVID-19, which has no approved treatment, it is very important to prevent the spread in the society. The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine. With increased testing capacity, detecting more positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.  \\nAs per WHO, in countries and/or subnational regions in which community transmission has become established, or that are at risk of entering this phase of an epidemic, authorities must immediately adopt and adapt population-level distancing measures and movement restrictions in addition to other public health and health system measures to reduce exposure and suppress transmission, including the following:\\nPersonal measures that reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission, such as hand washing, physicaldistancing, and respiratory etiquette;\\nCommunity-level measures to reduce contact between individuals, such as the suspension of mass gatherings,theclosure of non-essential places of work and educational establishments, and reduced public transport;\\nMeasures to reduce the risk of importation or reintroduction of the virus from high-transmission areas, such as limits on national and international travel, enhanced screeningand quarantine;\\nMeasures to ensure the protection of health workers andvulnerable groups, such as through the provision of correctpersonal protective equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "8   One of the studies, revealed a number of unreported mutations, which cover both mismatches and deletions in translated and untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Moreover, the geo-climate distribution of the mutations deciphered higher unique mutations as well as disease severity in the European temperate countries. Further investigations should focus on structural validations and subsequent phenotypic consequences of the deletions and/or mismatches in transmission dynamics of the current epidemics and the immediate implications of these genomic markers to develop potential prophylaxis and mitigation for tackling the crisis of pandemic COVID-19. Moreover, the identification of the conformational changes in mutated protein structures and untranslated cis-acting elements is of significance for studying the virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This mutational diversity should be investigated by further studies, including their metabolic functional pathway, intra-viral and virus-host interactions analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "9   The availability of established diagnostic technologies have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing an important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks. The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19. This process can curb the spread of infectious pathogens and reduce mortality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "11  One of the comparative analysis of COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension showed that hypertensive patients had greater disease severity and adverse progression than nonhypertensive patients. However, this result may be related to the higher age in this group than in nonhypertension group.

So, heart patients need to take additional, reasonable precautions in order to cut down their risk.\\nHeart patients who are considered to be at increased risk of developing COVID-19 are those who have:\\nHistory of heart attack or stroke\\nChronic heart failure\\nHeart valve disease\\nConditions that affect heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation\\nPeripheral artery disease\\nNarrowed blood vessels due to plaque build-up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "13  COPD patients have increased risk of severe pneumonia and poor outcomes when they develop COVID-19. This may be related to poor underlying lung reserves or increased expression of ACE-2 receptor in small airways.\\nThe  recent evidence that COPD patients and smokers may display the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry differently has come to light. Similar to SARS-CoV (which was responsible for the 2002–2003 SARS pandemic), SARS-CoV-2 bears an envelope spike protein that is primed by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 to facilitate fusion of the virus with the cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and subsequent cell entry. Current smoking was also associated with higher ACE-2 expression compared with former and never smokers, an observation which has subsequently been validated by other groups in separate cohorts of lung tissue and airway epithelial samples and supported by additional evidence linking ACE-2 expression with nicotine exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "14  COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "15  Researchers are still learning how COVID-19 affects pregnant women. Current reports suggest that pregnant women may have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that:\\nPregnant women with COVID-19 may be more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU) or need a ventilator (for breathing support).\\nPregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions.\\nPregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness from COVID-19 than other pregnant women. But it’s not about biology. Black and Hispanic women face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "16  Initially, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that the percentage of infected individuals who die from COVID-19 was 3.4%. That statistic is called the infection fatality rate (IFR) – or colloquially, the death rate – and means that for every hundred people infected with COVID-19, on average, between three and four would die.\\nAs time has gone on, it has become clear that the true risk of death is much lower. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently has a best guess of 0.65% for the IFR. But current estimates fall anywhere between 0.2% and 1%, a surprisingly large range when calculating the infection fatality rate should be as simple as dividing the number of deaths by total infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "17  The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:\\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\\nAvoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth.\\nStay home when sick.\\nCover the cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.\\nWash hands often with soap and water.\\nContact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.\\nSocial distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "20  \\n\\nSeveral methods exist for scientists to sequence an RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2. One common technique begins with collecting viral RNA and breaking it into small fragments. Scientists then transcribe the sequences into DNA and amplify them with polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescent markers in the reaction mixture help reveal the identity of the sequences being generated. Once scientists know the sequences of the fragments, they can computationally stitch the whole genome back together with the help of a reference sequence from a closely related virus.\\nSome of this work is conducted at large, specialized facilities, but because of advances in technology, genome sequencing can also be carried out in smaller labs. Hospitals and universities around the world are collecting samples from people with COVID-19.

While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. The number of mutations is relatively low, with mode per sample equaling 6, an average of 7.23, and very few samples having more than 15 events. Overall, no continent differs significantly from the average mutation rate, but there is a significant difference (one-way ANOVA p = 9.55 × 10?205) in the average number of mutations per sample between countries. Specifically, amongst the top 40 nations with the highest number of sequenced full viral genomes, these countries have a slightly but significant higher number of observed mutations per sample, when compared to the world's average: India: (8.40), Congo (8.30), Bangladesh (9.83), and Kazakhstan (9.47). On the other hand, the sequences from the following countries show a significantly lower mutational burden: Germany (6.09), Japan (4.55), Italy (5.92), Greece (5.91), Hong Kong (5.00), and Kenya (5.38). One must bear in mind that some sampling biases may affect this comparison: for example, some countries have generated the highest number of sequences in the early phases of the pandemic, and may have therefore observed fewer mutations (for example, Italy has not shared any sequence in the months of May and June 2020, the last two considered in our analysis). On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (>50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country. Upon manual inspection, these sequences do not appear to share similarities between each other, and are likely the product of technical sequencing errors.                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "22  The wearing of masks and social distancing have been common practices that have been followed in Asia to prevent COVID 19 spread.\\nIn East Asian countries, technology for contact for contact tracing has been extensively used for prevention of COVID 19 outbreaks and flattening the curve. In South Korea, private developers took it upon themselves to develop apps that supplement official government contact tracing efforts, which many find insufficient. Citizens supported these initiatives and downloaded the apps which helped in flattening the curve and avoid outbreaks. South Korea has been appreciated for its aggressive and efficient response in preventing the COVID 19 spread. \\nA vibrant democracy that has also won praise for its Covid-19 containment, Taiwan is believed to be the first to have used mobile phone tracking to enforce quarantines, which the government reportedly reinforces by calling those in quarantine twice a day to ensure they do not evade tracking by leaving their phones at home.\\nChina too re-purposed its vast existing system of digital surveillance for Covid-19 tracking to prevent further outbreaks.\\nIn India, complete nationwide lockdown was announced intially for two months and then gradual opening up of economy based on the known COVID 19 spread, increased testing capacity, contact tracing and containment zones are the techniques deployed to prevent the COVID 19 spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "0   Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are >5-10 ? In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Moreover, the identification of the conformational changes in mutated protein structures and untranslated cis-acting elements is of significance for studying the virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This mutational diversity should be investigated by further studies, including their metabolic functional pathway, intra-viral and virus-host interactions analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "9   The availability of established diagnostic technologies have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19.   \n",

While 256 samples, mostly originating from Asia, did not have any difference from the reference, 48,379 samples possessed at least one mutation. On the other hand, one would expect China to have a lower number of mutations, being the likely point of origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020), and indeed the distribution of mutations per sample seems to suggest that; however, a small number of sequences carrying a very high number (>50) of mutations are associated to China, shifting the distribution for this country.

In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported. Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer). There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

This mutational diversity should be investigated by further studies, including their metabolic functional pathway, intra-viral and virus-host interactions analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "9   The availability of established diagnostic technologies have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19.   \n",

In South Korea, private developers took it upon themselves to develop apps that supplement official government contact tracing efforts, which many find insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
